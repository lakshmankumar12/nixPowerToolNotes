# Add password
#
#The user password, if set, is what you need to provide in order to open a PDF.
#Acrobat/Reader will prompt a user to enter the user password. If it's not
#correct, the document will not open.

#The owner password, if set, controls permissions, such as printing, editing,
#extracting, commenting, etc. Acrobat/Reader will disallow these things
#based on the permission settings. Acrobat will require this password if you
#want to set/change permissions.

#Encrypt a PDF using 128-bit strength (the default), withhold all permissions (the default)
pdftk 1.pdf output 1.128.pdf owner_pw foopass

#Same as above, except password baz must also be used to open output PDF
