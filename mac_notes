2 finger for scroll
2 finger touch for right click
#New in MAC:
3 finger up -> show all windows. This is called mission-control
3 finger down ->
3 finger left/right -> for window change (like alt-tab)

Green-button           -- fullscreen
Double-click on title  -- zoom
Shift+Green-button     -- maximize w/o full-screen (Doesn't work?)

YET TO FIND:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* how to shift tabs (as in 3 finger scroll in chromebook) with gesture

AWESOME in mac
--------------

* Screen
* Speed it opens up -- both sleep/boot
* weight of the laptop!
* its full-screen mode
  * you still get system notifications
  * you hover mouse up and see the desktop status icons (and access everything off there)
* mouse gestures
* iterm integration with opening files by Command+click

Big Bummers in that order:
---------------------------

* Outlook has no format painter! [ :( ]
* zoom/maximize sometimes only vertically maximizes (eg: iTerm, chrome!, no option/shift/command click doesn't work)
* mission control should have a way to keyboard-select app of choice.
* Absence of a application-key that emulates a right click at a location.

Other inconveniences:
-----------------------

* how to shut display of mac with a second monitor, with mac lid open?
  * how to move all windows to another display in dual monitor case, where i haven't closed my mac-lid
   (using mirroring for now)
* mission control splashes all windows, but doesn't have a way to choose an app using keyboard.
* Hotkey to open up iTerm sucks at best, very unpredictable working sometimes and not working at times.
  Hotkey to lock too has same flaky behavior
    -- Found the proble. We need to ensure every app, shows this in its (apple) -> app -> services list.
* How to auto adjust font-size for iTerm based on display?
   -- I am just manually cmd- +/-'ing everytime
