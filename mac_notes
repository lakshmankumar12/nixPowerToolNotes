YET TO FIND:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* how to shift tabs (as in 3 finger scroll in chromebook) with gesture
* how to shut display of mac with a second monitor, with mac lid open?
  * how to move all windows to another display in dual monitor case, where i haven't closed my mac-lid
   (using mirroring for now)
* zoom/maximize sometimes only vertically maximizes (eg: iTerm, chrome!, no option/shift/command click doesn't work)
* mission control splashes all windows, but doesn't have a way to choose an app using keyboard.
* Hotkey to open up iTerm sucks at best, very unpredictable working sometimes and not working at times.
  Hotkey to lock too has same flaky behavior
* How to auto adjust font-size for iTerm based on display?
