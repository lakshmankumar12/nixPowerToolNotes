YET TO FIND:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* how to shift tabs (as in 3 finger scroll in chromebook) with gesture

Wish List
~~~~~~~~~

* Some nice way to sepearate 2 chrome windows and go to a paritcular instance on choice.
   Thus work-related tabs is in one chrome, while personal tabs are in another

AWESOME in mac
--------------

* Screen Resolution :)
* Speed with which its ready to work on -- both sleep/boot
* weight of the laptop
* its full-screen mode
  Exactly how i want it.
  * you still get system notifications popped up.
  * you hover mouse up and see the desktop status icons (and access system stuff off there)
    instead of having to exit full-screen first!
* iterm integration with opening files by "open"
* mouse gestures
* terminal + desktop - both are first class citizens

small cute things in mac
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* native ability to map caplock (i mapped to command)
* native ability to O(1) switch to another app by typing its name - spotlight
  (i although use quick-silver) 
  -- typing the app, just opens the running instance, instead of spawning a new one!

Big Bummers in that order:
---------------------------

* Outlook has no format painter! [ :( ] And doesn't paste-text with formatting preserved. Yikes!
* Auto-hotkey (karabiner seems unavailable in mac-os, that is suggested as alternative)
  I basically just need scrollup/down, and hjkl map for arrow.
* zoom/maximize sometimes only vertically maximizes (eg: iTerm, chrome!, no option/shift/command click doesn't work either)
* Absence of a application-key that emulates a right click at a location.

Other inconveniences:
-----------------------

* how to shut display of mac with a second monitor, with mac lid open?
  * how to move all windows to another display in dual monitor case, where i haven't closed my mac-lid
   (using mirroring for now)
* Hotkey to open up iTerm sucks at best, very unpredictable working sometimes and not working at times.
  Hotkey to lock too has same flaky behavior
    -- For one, we need to ensure every service-shortcut shows up in (apple) -> app -> services list.
* How to auto adjust font-size for iTerm based on display?
   -- I am just manually cmd- +/-'ing everytime
* I would like to change the lock-up screen - com.apple.desktop.admin.png keeps reverting after some time!
 

Turned out to be non-issues
--------------------------

* mission control should have a way to keyboard-select app of choice.
  -- Just use spotlight.

Quick-Silver
