== logarithms

----
log x  =   log x        # Way to convert a log to a different base. Here we need
   d          b         # log of x to base-d. But we dont know. We know logs of
           ------       # base b though. So, this formula helps us to convert
           log d        # to another base. It has a pattern. Numberator has the
              b         # same number to take log for, with base-replaced. RHS has
                        # both numbers to the friendly base. Denominator is the
                        # unknown number which was the base on LHS.

== Combinatoris

****

~n~C~r~ = n! / ( (n-r)! * r! )

~n~P~r~ = n! / (n-r)!

~n~C~r~ = ~n~P~r~ / r!

~n~C~r~ = ~n-1~C~r-1~ + ~n-1~C~r~

* This is the class case of reducing a combinaion into smaller sub-problems
* We are eiher picking the 1st and doing a combination for remaining n-1 items
  AND we are not picking 1st and doing a combination for remaining n items in
  the smaller subset.

~n~C~n~ = 1

~n~C~1~ = n
