# Unix-Power-Tools Notes

This is a collection of my notes on various unix commands.

I realized that googling and finding a stack-overflow answer everytime I needed the
same thing felt repeitive, and this can be quicked by writing a local cache!
This not only improved my time, but also helped me ingrain those answers.

Most of this is written in notes-making-style that I am familiar with - so, it is
unlikely that that it will be useful as-is to anyone else. You are better off
googling and collecting the answer yourself from the right sources. But this
repository can be glanced to see if something is of use to you and add it to
your own notes.
