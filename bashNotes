substring
----------

${i:index}     .. substring of i starting at index(0-based)
${i:index:len} .. substring of i starting at index(0-based) for length len

Filenames and extractions
------------------------

filename=$(basename "$fullpathfile")
dirname=$(dirname "$fullpathfile")
extension="${filename##*.}"
filename="${filename%.*}"


Arrays
------

index is a number. Gaps are okay when initializing. those members dont exist

${Array[index]}    

Iterating over each line of a  file
-----------------------------------

while read i ; do echo "one line: $i" ; done < file

Note: for i in $(cat line) .. will interate over each word of the file, not line!
Note: cat file | while     .. wont cut it as while will work in a bash of its own and variables modifed inside
                                         while wont be seen by this bash.
